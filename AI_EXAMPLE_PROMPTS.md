# ðŸ§ª AI Experiment Generator - Example Prompts

## ðŸŽ¯ **Test These Prompts**

Copy and paste any of these examples into the AI Generator to see how it works:

### **1. E-commerce Button Test**

```
I want to test if changing the "Add to Cart" button from blue to green will increase purchases on my product pages. The button is currently blue and I want to see if a green color will make it more appealing and increase conversion rates. I'm thinking of testing this on all product pages for 2 weeks and measuring the conversion rate as the success metric.
```

### **2. Landing Page Headline Test**

```
I want to test different headlines on my landing page to see which one converts better. Currently I have "Get Started Today" but I want to test "Start Your Free Trial" and "Join 10,000+ Happy Customers" to see which drives more sign-ups. I want to measure sign-up rate and target new visitors only.
```

### **3. Pricing Page Test**

```
I want to test if showing a discount badge on my pricing page will increase sales. I want to test showing "20% OFF" vs no badge on the premium plan. This should run for 3 weeks and I want to measure the purchase rate for the premium plan specifically.
```

### **4. Checkout Flow Test**

```
I want to test if adding a progress bar to my checkout process will reduce cart abandonment. Currently users just see the form, but I want to test showing a 3-step progress bar (Cart â†’ Shipping â†’ Payment) to see if it improves completion rates.
```

### **5. Mobile App Onboarding**

```
I want to test different onboarding flows for my mobile app. Currently I show 3 screens explaining features, but I want to test a single screen with key benefits vs the current 3-screen approach. I want to measure completion rate and time to first action.
```

### **6. Email Signup Test**

```
I want to test different email signup forms on my blog. Currently I have a simple email field, but I want to test adding a benefit like "Get weekly tips" vs "Join our newsletter" to see which gets more subscribers. I want to measure signup rate and target blog visitors.
```

### **7. Feature Announcement Test**

```
I want to test how I announce new features to existing users. Currently I show a popup, but I want to test a banner at the top of the dashboard vs the popup to see which gets more feature adoption. I want to measure click-through rate and feature usage.
```

### **8. Pricing Display Test**

```
I want to test how I display pricing on my SaaS landing page. Currently I show monthly pricing, but I want to test showing annual pricing with savings vs monthly to see which converts better. I want to measure trial signup rate and target visitors who scroll to the pricing section.
```
